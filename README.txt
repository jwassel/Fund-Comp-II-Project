This is our final project repository for Fundamentals of Computing II, Spring 2013. We have titled our game "Pokedome," combining the Pokemon enemies we use, and the dome they attack. 

This program is a game written using c++ and the SDL graphics library. The goal of the game is to shoot all the enemies (the pokemon) before they can attack the golden dome. The pokemon will enter from the sides, and approach the dome. They will do no damage if you shoot (click) on them before they reach the dome. If they reach the dome, they will slowly destroy the dome. If the dome is destroyed you lose!

Future Additions: 
Multiple levels
More Pokemon Enemies
More Weapons
Points System
Buying Weapon upgrades and repairing dome between levels
Sound
