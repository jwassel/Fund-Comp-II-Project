To pull origin master (do every time before you make changes/login):

git pull origin master

Then to add files:

git add name_of_file/folder
git commit -m 'message of commit goes here'
git push




Link to set up:

https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys

Then close the repository by doing (should only have to do this once, reccommend doing this in your home directory):
git clone insert_link_on_github_here


then once you clone the repository cd into .git, open the config file and change 
the https://github.com/...somejunk to ssh://git@github.com/..somejunk

Then cd into ~./ssh and openthe id_rsa.pub file and copy the entire file (the ssh key).

Go into Github's website, go to your account settings, go to SSH Keys on the left and add your ssh key you just copied. 

You should now be able to add files (look above)
