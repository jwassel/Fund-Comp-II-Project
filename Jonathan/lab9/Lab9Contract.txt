Oliver Lamb and Jonathan Cobian

10 points (Jonathan): done
	Finish the enemy class hierarchy to inherit from a sprite class and to have image names to be part of the enemy class.

10 points (Oliver):
	To work on the Castle class and create a function that checks the Castle's health and changes the image of the Dome with 		respect its health to make it look like it is deteriorating with its health. We may change it to a Dome class if we can 	find appropriate images.

15 points:
	Create an enemy moveTo function which moves the enemy towards the castle.

15 points:
	Create an attackCastle function within the enemy class which decreases the castle's health.

15 points:
	Create a collisionDetection function so that we tell when the enemy hits the castle and begin the attackCastle function. 	The moveTo function may also incorporate the collisionDetection function so that it knows when to stop moving when it 		reaches the castle.

15 points: done
	Create more subclasses for enemies such as pikachu, charmander, bulbasaur, etc. 
	These will work like our current Squirtle one except the move functions will be different and the images obviously.
