Jason Wassel
Lab 9 Contract

For next week: I want to be able to have a mouse driven event that will have the image disappear if clicked on. I imagine this will be fairly hard because it will involve collision detection with the mouse. When the position is clicked on, a shooting animation will also come from a fixed point to this location. Also, if my other group members have not done so for this week's lab, I want to finish loading all the enemy classes.
